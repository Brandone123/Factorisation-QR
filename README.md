# Factorisation-QR
Factorisation QR  de House Holder

"""
This is the code for QR factorization using Householder Transformation.
This program is made in python 3.5.3 but will be compatible to any python 3.4+ version
We used numpy library for matrix manipulation.
Install numpy using **pip3 install numpy** command on terminal.
To run the code write **python3 factorisationQR.py** on terminal
User has to give dimension of the matrix as input in space separated format and matrix will be generated randomly.
QR factorization can be done for both square and non-square matrices and hence the code supports both.
